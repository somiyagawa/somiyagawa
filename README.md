- 👋 Hi, I’m @somiyagawa
- 👀 I’m interested in natural language processing for low-resource languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning transfer learning such as BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and RAG using LLMs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building corpora of Coptic, Old Nubian, Ryukyuan, and Truku Seediq languages.
- 📫 How to reach me please write an email to miyagawa.so.36u AT u.tsukuba.ac.jp .
